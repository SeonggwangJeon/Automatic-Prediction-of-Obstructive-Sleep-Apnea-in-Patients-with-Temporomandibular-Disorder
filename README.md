# Automatic Prediction of Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Patients with Temporomandibular Disorder based on Multidata and Machine Learning

This repository contains the code for the paper "Automatic Prediction of Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Patients with Temporomandibular Disorder based on Multidata and Machine Learning" by Yeon-Hee Lee, Seonggwang Jeon, Q-Schick Auh. The code includes data preprocessing, model training and testing, Grad-CAM heatmap generation, and activation visualization for the detection of OSA prediction using machine learning learning techniques.
